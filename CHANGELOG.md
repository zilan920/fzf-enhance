# fzf-enhance Changelog

## v2.0.0 - 2024-01-XX - Major Update

### ðŸ”§ Major Fixes

- **Fixed alias naming rules**: Corrected the naming logic when registering aliases

  - Before: Included `f` prefix at function call time (e.g., `register_fzf_alias ff`)
  - Now: Pass base name, function decides whether to add prefix based on `FZF_ENHANCE_OVERRIDE`
  - Impact: All command naming is now more consistent and predictable

- **Added forced prefix functionality**: Prevents conflicts with system commands
  - Added third parameter to `register_fzf_alias` function for forced prefix
  - 13 aliases that would conflict with system commands will force the `f` prefix
  - Includes: `fkill`, `fcd`, `fcp`, `fmv`, `fmkdir`, `ftop`, `fping`, `fhost`, `fservice`, `fenv`, `fdocker`, `fnode`, `ftest`
  - Even in override mode (`FZF_ENHANCE_OVERRIDE=1`), these commands still maintain the prefix
  - Resolves user concerns about system command conflicts
